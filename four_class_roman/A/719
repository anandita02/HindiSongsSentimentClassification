Something has to be done
You got to finish what you begun
Something just has to be done
You can't hide, you can't run
Now i am spinning Out of control
Out of control, Out of control
Spinning Out of controlKya hain tere karam
Kahaan se shuru
Kahaan ho khatam
Kya hain tere karam
Bhaage kahaan tere kadam
Tera jahaan beh chala
Beh chala, beh chalaa...
Jahaan beh chalaa.... aa..Something always go wrong
You did your best
But it all came undone
Something always go wrong
Even though you tried for so long 
Now I am spinning Out of control
Out of control
Out of control..
Spinning Out of control....You just didn't walk out..
You just didn't walk out..
You just didn't walk out..
The way I planned itYou just didn't walk out..
You just didn't walk out..
You just didn't walk out..
The way I planned it
But I tried.. oh how I triedYou can't hide, you can't run
I am spinninn Out of control [Beh chala]
Out of control [Beh chala]
Out of control
Spinning Out of control oo...
