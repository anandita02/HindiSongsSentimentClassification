It's a feeling I have love
It's a feeling I wantIt's a feeling that I want to too
It's a feeling I have love
It's a feeling I want
It's a feeling that I want to tooIt's time you own her baby
Listen baby I don't care
You come around I'm no way
Listen baby I don't care
It's time you feelin' so good
It's time I'm feelin' so fade
I want to say no never
Baby it's not my timeIt's not my time
It's not my timeTharthraate hain lamhe
Tab rookh badalta hai
Door saahilon par
Kahin din yeh dhalta hai
Tharthraate hain lamhe
Tab rookh badalta hai
Door saahilon par
Kahin din yeh dhalta hai
Katra katra sannata
Mome sa pighalta hai
Khelne waala koi nahi
Khel phir bhi chalta hai
Sau chehre aayein jaayein
Yaadon mein wohi reh jaayeBeparwah! (I gotta feel it now)
Beparwah (you gotta feel it now) ho jaaye jo x (2)It's time you own her baby
Listen baby I don't care
You come around I'm no way
Listen baby I don't care
It's time you feelin' so good
It's time I'm feelin' so fade
I want to say no never
Baby it's not my timeAankhon pe bharosa na kar
Dhoka hai har ek manzar
Milte hain jo gale khul ke
Wohi vaar karein chhup kar
Shor mein hai sarghoshi
Hosh mein hai behoshi
Honth sabke sil jaayenge
Bolegi jab khaamoshiSau chehre aayein jaayein
Yaadon mein wohi reh jaayeBeparwah! (I gotta feel it now)
Beparwah (you gotta feel it now) ho jaaye jo x (2)Let me tell you now beparwah
Want to feeling now beparwah x (4)Kuchh halka kuchh gehra
Raaz hai lab pe thehra
Jaal ke andar jaal hai
Chehre pe hai chera
Hansti aankhon waale sabhi
Meethi baaton waale
Honth se naa chhoona kabhi
Yeh zehar ke pyaale
Sau chehre aayein jaayein
Yaadon mein wohi reh jaayeBeparwah! (I gotta feel it now)
Beparwah (you gotta feel it now) ho jaaye jo x (2)Beparwah hoo..
Beparwah hoo let me tell you
Let me tell you now
Beparwah kal kya ho, kya na
Beparwah hoo...
