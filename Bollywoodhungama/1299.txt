Keh Do Zara  Remix
Jaane Kahan Se Aayi Hai


Chalte chalte yun lagey, I wanna walk all the way with you
Rukk jaun to kyun lagey, something is leading me about to you
Chalte chalte yun lagey, I wanna walk all the way with you
Rukk jaun to kyun lagey, something is leading me about to you
Hosh mein bhi kaise bekhata ho gaya
Deewano ke jaise baby maybe I've been following youSo is this love, this must be love
It's gotta be love coz i have been loved ..
So is this love, keh do zara
This must be love, keh do zara
It's gotta be love, keh do zara
Coz i have been loved ..
Keh do zara, keh do zara ..Pooche jo koi mujhse to main subah ko shaam keh doon
Bhool jaun ghar ka rasta, kuch kaam main kuch bhi naam keh doon
Na jaane aisa kya kamaal ho gaya
Deewano ke jaise baby maybe I've been following youSo is this love, keh do zara
This must be love, keh do zara
It's gotta be love, keh do zara
Coz i have been loved ..
Keh do zara, keh do zara ..Aankhon se neendhein gum hai, seenay se dil bhi laapta hai
Behke behke se armaan hai, lag raha gadbad maamla hai
Main na jaanu kaisa mera haal ho gaya
Deewano ke jaise baby maybe I've been following youSo is this love, keh do zara
This must be love, keh do zara
It's gotta be love, keh do zara
Coz i have been loved ..Chalte chalte yun lagey, I wanna walk all the way with you
Rukk jaun to kyun lagey, something is leading me about to you
Hosh mein bhi kaise bekhata ho gaya
Deewano ke jaise baby maybe I've been following youSo is this love, this must be love
It's gotta be love coz i have been loved ..
So is this love, keh do zara
This must be love, keh do zara
It's gotta be love, keh do zara
Coz i have been loved ..
Keh do zara, keh do zara ..
