I Dont Luv U Club Version
I Dont Luv U


Teri baatein dil ko chhoo jaayein
Teri adaayein ghazab sa dhaayein
Kyun hai aisa main kya jaanu
Lekin pyaar isko main na maanooOh girl, you are always only mine
Just want to hold you and make you mine
It's all true but I don't love youI don't love you
I don't love you
What I say is really true
But I don't love youI don't love you
I don't love you
What I say is really true
But I don't love youTum hi mere khayaalon mein ho
Sapnon mein ho, nigaahon mein ho
Dil ki yeh haalat main na samjhoon
Lekin pyaar isko kaise keh doonOh boy, you are always only mine
Wanna be with you all the time
It's all true but I don't love youI don't love you
I don't love you
What I say is really true
But I don't love youI don't love you
I don't love you
What I say is really true
But I don't love youKisi roz tumse jo main mil na paaoon
Lage kuchh kami hai, main gumsum ho jaaoon
Ho.. tere baare mein sabse baatein karoon
Aur akele mein thandi aahein bharoon
Tanha tanha main rehna chaahoon
Lekin pyaar isko main na maanu
Har pal tujhse main milna chahoon
Lekin pyaar isko kaise keh doonOh girl, you are always only mine
Just want to hold you and make you mine
It's all true but I don't love youOh boy, you are always only mine
Wanna be with you all the time
It's all true but I don't love youGift dene ka tujhko main dhoondhu bahaana
Baat karne ko tujhse yun hi baatein banaana
Jo aaine mein khud ko main nihara karoon
Chupke chupke tujhe main ishaara karoonKeh na paaoon jo kehna chahoon
Lekin pyaar isko main na maanu
Jo tu hans de to main bhi hans doon
Lekin pyaar isko kaise keh doonOh girl, you are always only mine
Just want to hold you and make you mine
It's all true but I don't love youOh boy, you are always only mine
Wanna be with you all the time
It's all true but I don't love youI don't love you
I don't love you
What I say is really true
But I don't love youI don't love you
I don't love you
What I say is really true
But I don't love youI don't love you
I don't love you
What I say is really true
But I don't love youI don't love you
I don't love you
What I say is really true
But I don't love you
