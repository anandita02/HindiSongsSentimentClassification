Better Not Mess With Me Rock Mix
Always Kabhi Kabhi


Tedhe mere raaston ko seedha main bana doon
Mujhe jo sikhaane aaye usse main sikha doon
Who the hell are you to tell me what to do
Rules khudi main likhun aur khudi main mitaa doon
You better not mess with me
Mere dil mein jo aaye woh main karoon
You better not mess with me
Kisi se bhi aakhir haan main kyun daroon
Just leave me alone I wanna be on my own
Kyun chhup rahoon main kyun sab sahoonJo bhi chaaha na mila toh maine usse cheena
Keh diya toh dil mein aaya, honthon ko kya seena
Who the hell are you to tell me what to do
Mujhe hai pasand bas issi tarah jeena
Better not mess with me
Meri saanson mein bada zor hai
You better not mess with me
Meri dhadkano mein bhi shor hai
Just leave me alone I wanna be on my own
Kyun chhup rahoon main kyun sab sahoonKhuda hai aasma jisme main bandh hoon
Apne bas mein nahin lekin bas mein hi hoon
Mere andhar mere andhar, ik toofan hai
Mere andhar mere andhar, har subah shaam haiJo bhi chaaha na mila toh maine usse cheena
Keh diya toh dil mein aaya, honthon ko kya seena
Who the hell are you to tell me what to do
Mujhe hai pasand bas issi tarah jeena
Better not mess with me
Mere dil mein jo aaye main woh karoon
You better not mess with me
Kisi se bhi aakhir haan main kyun daroon
Just leave me alone I wanna be on my own
Kyun chhup rahoon main kyun sab sahoon
