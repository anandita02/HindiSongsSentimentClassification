Life Is A Game  English Version
Teen Patti


1 in to 2equal to probability of hand 3
and given hand into probability of hand 4
given 1 and 2 into probability of hand 5 given hand 1 and 2...paisa kya hai, sirf ek number na
galat, bhuk hai paisa, bhuk
just a question of numbers, just a matter of chance
there are questions and answers thus, they never dance
if you want to seduce by power, the rain and shadow will die
when you are running for cover, you find no way out
coz when night comes calling, you ran on your own
coz life is a game, that is so strange
you never know how rules may change
once the dice is rolled
you know that you just gonna start playing the game
play the game, play the game, play the game
tumhe kya lagata hai
yeh jo jeevan tum log jee rahe ho, yeh koyi, yeh koyi khel hai
that its a bloody gameanother crazy equation, another twist in the tale
little miscalculation, you don' t wanna pay
luck is shining in your favour, probability is high, so high
if you wanna have to bravo, who will do or die
but when you walk the fine line, there' s no guarantee
coz life is a game, that is so strange
you never know how the rules may change
once the dice is rolled
you know that you just gonna start playing the game
play the game, play the game, play the game.....
jo hai woh nahi hai, aur jo nahi hai woh ho sakata hai
ha ha ha... i' m gonna keep on playing the game
sab khel hai, khel hai baby, i' ll tell you
