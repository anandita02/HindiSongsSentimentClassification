Its All About Tonight
Ishkq In Paris


Tu hai main hoon aur thoda nasha hai
Nahin koi hum jaisa yahaan hai
Gonna break the, rules
Baby let it, loose
Saare wrong aaj kar lenge right
It's all about tonight night night..
It's all about tonight night night..
Tonight is going right right..
Oh yeah it's all about tonight night night..
It's all about tonight night night..
It's all about tonight night night..
Tonight is going right right..
Oh yeah it's all about tonight night night..French lyricsHai ladkhadaaye dono, behke behkaaye dono
Jhoome aise zamana dekhe saaraHai junoon ab naya
Hai suroor aap kaKoi roke, show
Usse kehde, show
Going high and we flyin' tonight
It's all about tonight night night..
It's all about tonight night night..
Tonight is going right right..
It's all about tonight night night..
It's all about tonight night night..Baahon mein daale baahein
Karle hum bhi jo bhi chaahe
Masti bhare yeh pal khone na deHai junoon ab naya
Hai suroor aap kaBaby shout it, show
Thoda harder, show
Yehi mauka hai make it tonightIt's all about tonight night night..
It's all about tonight night night..
Tonight is going right
It's all about tonight night night...
