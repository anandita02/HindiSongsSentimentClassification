Ooo.saya.yero mayoo.
Aaa rooo aa yoooo.Aaa roha mazoo mayoo
Hey aaa yoooDont touch me dont
Dont touch me dont
Dont touch me dont They cant touch me
We break off run so faster
They cant even touch me
Been that you see
Touch me.i ll show you choose
Run zig zag quickly
Pick up the pack of my journey
Dont suddenly start to follow me
I m a luck some days the suck
We live by the buck
We get for the familyOne day i wanna be a star
So i get to hang in a bar
I ll go to vegas and play off
Just to forget my scarsEk do teen char panch che saath aat nao das gyara bara teraaSweat shops have made me shifty
Like a ninja with speed i am nifty
I hope i live till i am fifty
See my city go a quick to a thriftyOoo saya yero mayoo.
