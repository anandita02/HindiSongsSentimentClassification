Nobody Like You
Mission Istaanbul


ha,ha tu toh hai wahi,woh mera hamnashi
tu hi,tu hi hai meri jindagi ka woh
sapna mila jo hai yahaan,sama milega abb kaha
can you feel it,music counting
stars are shining and and we're branding
we were moving,we were winding
girl i feel that damn there is nobody like you.aati jaati raahon mein jo surat thi anjaani si woh hai yaha
i have been waiting for you
socha mere khaabon mein khayaalon mein hamesha ha tu hai wahi
i been searching for you
teri yeh nigaahe yeh adaaye jab bhi chaahe le le jaan meri
i been living for you
aake teri baahon ke panaahon mein luta du main yeh jindagi
can you feel it,music counting
stars are shining and and we're branding
we were moving,we were winding
boy i feel that damn there is nobody like you.
