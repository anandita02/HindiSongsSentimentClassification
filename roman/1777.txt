Ishq Da Bukhar
Mad About Dance


Oh aa.. Lage mainu har pal sona sang tu sathiya Dil sadda bhangra paave na paave boliyaan Teri gall sunte hi lagge gungi duniya Saari raat menu neend na aave, khuli ankhiyanAa..maahiyaa.. Chadheya mainu ishq da bukhar Ni bacha le mainu Chadheya mainu ishq da bukharOoh.. I was on the roads to nowhere You show me the way I wants to dance n feel free Maybe i should dare Should i open these doors and Not be too scared Should i let you win my heart Will you promise me you'll stay Promise me you'll stay Promise me you'll stay Promise me you'll stay Ooh...Teri sohn kudiye Chadheya mainu ishq da bukhar Ni bacha le mainu Chadheya mainu ishq da bukhar.
