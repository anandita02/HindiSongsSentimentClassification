Jiya Re
Jab Tak Hai Jaan


Chali re, chali re Junoon ko liye
Katra, katra lamho ko diye
Pinjre se udaa dil ka shikra
Khudi se maine ishq kiya reJiya jiya re jiya re Jiya jiya re jiya re
Jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oooo..
Jiya jiya re jiya re Jiya jiya re jiya re
Jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oo oo..Chali re, chali re Junoon ko liye
Pinjre se udaa dil ka shikra
Khudi se maine ishq kiya reJiya jiya re jiya re Jiya jiya re jiya re
Jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oo..
Jiya jiya re jiya re Jiya jiya re jiya re
Jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oo..Make the way for Akira
Pop it up, move aside she is here
Hey get up everybody wanna be her
Wanna see her, she is AkiraChhote chhote lamho ko teetli jaise pakdo toh
Haathon mein rang reh jaata hai
Pankho se jab chhodo toh
Waqt chalta hai
Waqt ka magar rang utarta hai Akira
Udhte udhte phir ek lamha maine pakad liya reJiya jiya re jiya re Jiya jiya re jiya re
Jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oo..
Jiya jiya re jiya re Jiya jiya re jiya re
Jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oo..Make the way for AkiraHalke halke pardo mein Muskurana achha lagta hai
Roshni jo deta ho toh Phir jalana achha lagta hai
Ek pal sahi, umar bhar isse saath rakhna Akira
Zindagi se phir ek vaada maine kar liya reJiya jiya re jiya re Jiya jiya re jiya re
Jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oo..
Jiya jiya re jiya re Jiya jiya re jiya re
Jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oo..Chali re, chali re junoon ko liye
Pinjre se udha dil ka shikra
Khudi se maine ishq kiya reJiya jiya re jiya re Jiya jiya re jiya re
Jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oo..
Jiya jiya re jiya re Jiya jiya re jiya re
Jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oo..
