Kites


( Fire Love Is Hell )Love and lustfest will make you bechain
Yeh na poocho kyun ya when
Fire, got to sell, got to sell, sell your soulFire, got to sell, got to sell, sell your soul
Love and lust can make you blind
That will play with your mindLove is the game you play, darr is the price you pay
If you wanna grow older way you got to go for it today
Don't listen to the word they say, forever is an old cliche
Jitna karoge tum prey, love is never gonna stay
Fire, got to sell, got to sell, sell your soulLove and lustfest will make you bechain
Yeh na poocho kyun ya when
Fire, got to sell, got to sell, sell your soul
Got to sell, got to sell, sell your soul
