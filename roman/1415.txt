Hey Walla
Jism  2


Wake up to the call to the sounds around me
Say, live your dreams your destiny awayHear the rhythm then near inside me
Are you ready live on love
See the color shine in from your heart
Are you ready live on loveWake up to the dazzling stars above me
Sing, spread your wings and fly to the sky
Hear the rhythm then near inside me
Are you ready live on loveSee the color shine in from your heart
Are you ready live on love..Rise up high to the sky
Leave your..
Hey walla
Fly to the sky
Destiny await
Hey walla
