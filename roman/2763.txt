There's somethin' about tonight, somethin' very special
There's something about the way you move that thing, somethin' very special
Something about the way you lookin' at me, somethin' very special
Yeah there's somethin' about tonight, somethin' very specialLa la nasheeli..There's somethin' about tonight, somethin' very special
There's something about the way you move that thing, somethin' very special
Something about the way you lookin' at me, somethin' very special
Yeah there's somethin' about tonight, somethin' very specialHere we goSaari ki saari, duniya bhula ke
Main toh tere naal nachna
(baby you so sexy)Boy you could be my, one and only
Main toh tere naal nachnaThen I see you lookin' at me
Aaja baat kar le dil kiHone lagenge afsaane
You know it, so sing it
Now throw your hands up and say
Disco deewane, aha, aha
Hoo disco deewane, aha, ahaThere's somethin' about tonight, somethin' very special
There's something about the way you move that thing, somethin' very special
Something about the way you lookin' at me, somethin' very special
Yeah there's somethin' about tonight, somethin' very specialHoo hai na mujh pe nazar teri
Aankhon hi aankhon mein baatein hoti hain
Aaja baahon mein aa meri
Aise hi toh raatein shuru hoti hain
Kabhi kabhi pal do pal mein yun
Fasi fasi baatein hoti hain
Yunhi mulakaaton mein mil jaate hain zamaaneDisco deewane
You know it, so sing it
Now throw your hands up and say
Disco deewane, aha, aha
Disco deewane, aha, ahaNasheeli hai raat, do haathon mein haath
Naache gaaye saath
Disco deewane, aha, ahaDis dis.. coKhel jadaaton ka, khel yeh thodi der
Jhoom ja baahon mein tu aake aa meri thodi der
Naazron se hi main, aha
Tujhko sab chaatunga, aha
Raat baaki hai saari hosh udha de bas thodi der
Dance like deewana tonight
Move like mastana tonight
Party like parwana tonight
Jo kehna hai keh de
You gotta do the D.I.S.C.O
When everybody knows where we gonna go
Hotey hotey milte hain mil jaate hain bahaaneYou know it, so sing it
Now throw your hands up and say
Disco deewane, aha, aha
Hoo disco deewane, aha, ahaNasheeli hai raat, do haathon mein haath
Naache gaaye saathIshq wala love, ishq wala love, ishq wala love
Surkh wala soz wala faiz wala love
Ishq wala love
Hota hai jo love se zyada waise wala loveThere's somethin' about tonight, somethin' very special
There's something about the way you move that thing, somethin' very special
Something about the way you lookin' at me, somethin' very special
Yeah there's somethin' about tonight, somethin' very special
