I DonT Know What To Do  Remix
Housefull


This is the night baby, get a right maybeHaule haule dheere dheere aana meri baahon mein aa jana
Pyaasi pyaasi (o yes) marr jayungi, aise mujhe aise tadpa na
Na kar na kar zara bhi fikar
Mila mila nazar se nazar
Aaja tujhe heaven dikhaungiHaye I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
Tauba aagey kya karun
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
Tauba aagey kya karunI don't know how, I don't know what, I don't know whyHalke halke, dheeme dheeme bikhri meri zulfein sulja na
Main na doori seh paungi, aisi waisi baaton mein sulja na
Nasha mera nasha chayega
Mazaa bada mazaa aayega
Aaja tujhe heaven dikhaungiHaye I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
Tauba aagey kya karun
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
Tauba aagey kya karunHey darr jata hoon, gabhrata hoon
Aagey main kaise badun
Anjaan hoon inn raahon se, parbhat main kaise chadunNa kar na kar zara bhi fikar
Mila mila nazar se nazar
Aaja tujhe heaven dikhaungiHaye I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
Tauba aagey kya karun
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
Tauba aagey kya karun
Aagey kya karun - 3 times
