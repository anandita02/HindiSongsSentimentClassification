Stay A Little Longer
Half Girlfriend


Will you ever come find me
Will you ever come find me
Will you ever be mineNeed you now, oh hold me closer
Need you now, oh hold me closer
Stop the wheels of timeWhen I close my eyes
You’re here by my side
Oh when I close my eyes
You’re here by my sideAll I ever really need is your love
Nothing I could say would ever be enoughStay a little longer with me, baby!
Won’t you stay a little longer with me
Stay a little longer with me, baby!
Oh just stay a little longer with meI’ve been waiting for something new
I’ve been waiting for something new
Now I know it’s for you…The silver lining to my dark cloud
The silver lining to my dark cloud
Truth in this world of doubtNow that I have you
Oh don’t let me go
Now that I have you
Oh don’t let me go
Oh I know that time to leave has come
I’m not ready for this moment to be doneStay a little longer with me, baby!
Won’t you stay a little longer with me
Stay a little longer with me, baby!
Oh just stay a little longer with meHo…Won’t let go, cannot ever let go
The light of your memories
Won’t let go, cannot ever let go
Every joy, every misery (x2)Oh ho, what’s this feeling?
It’s just so true
Cross the seven seas
Give my life for you
There is nothing that I wouldn’t doStay a little longer with me baby
Won’t you stay a little longer with me baby
Please stay a little longer with me baby
Won’t you stay a little longer with me…Don’t ever leave me now
Don’t you please?
Stay a little longer with me baby
Won’t you stay?
Need you here… with me…
