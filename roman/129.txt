Ae Dil Hai Mushkil


Pyaar maine jo nibhaya
Tere rehte tere saath bhi
Sach kahun toh tujhse zyada
Chaha tujhko tere baad bhiHmm..
Main dard hoon
Tu dava hai na
Main aag hoon
Tu hawa hai naAli, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Kahan hai tu
Mere dil mein hai na
Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Tera hoon main
Tujhe yaad hai na (x2)Sooraj dhale toh lagta hai jaise
Kaandhe pe mere sar hai tera
Mera thikana chahe jahan ho
Yaadon mein meri ghar hai tera (x2)Main hoon jahan, tu wahan hai na
Main aag hoon, tu hawa hai naAli, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Kahan hai tu
Mere dil mein hai na
Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Tera hoon main
Tujhe yaad hai na (x2)In the darkness, you help me find a spark
The sweetest soul with the kindest heart
If only you could see you the way I do
You see the sunshine and it’s beautiful
Yeah! And all you have to do is smile
I give anything to be there just to see you nowToday with you in the warmth of summers night
I watch the moon and stars come to life
Can’t begin to explain just what you think for me
Yeah there was something when I close my eyes
I still could feel you from the emptiness
Thats how I know she's still here for meI cried a thousand times for you
Walked a million miles for you
You won't still be there to see
You will be leaving without me
