We Are Like This Only
Gippi


Look look at as flow co
Look look at as flow coChaahe jahaan hum jaayein.. halla
Jahaan nazar hum pherein.. halla
Zara zara bach ke re.. halla
Zara zara bach ke re
Because we are dangerous
Want to change the world
So shout it out loud 
If you're feeling like one of usJhalle, pagle, jungli
We are like this only
We are like this only
Aaddhe tedhe nautanki
We are like this only
We are like this onlyPuri duniya mein bawaal
Dekho dekho yeh kamaal
Seedhi kar de sabki chaal
Like this onlyIt's like, waqt hai badla, duniya badli
Tu bhi badal jaa
Aaja saath mein ho le
Yehi hai mauka
Tu bhi sambhal ja
Because we used to be loosers
But we changed the game
Now we're the winners
As we changed the game..Dangerous.. we want to change the world
So shout it out loud 
If you're feeling like one of usJhalle, pagle, jungli
We are like this only
We are like this only
Aaddhe tedhe nautanki
We are like this only
We are like this onlyPuri duniya mein bawaal
Dekho dekho yeh kamaal
Seedhi kar de sabki chaal
Like this onlyD-d-don't you take me for a fool
I'll send you back to school
It's my moment, it's my mood
Like this, like this..
We are like this only..
